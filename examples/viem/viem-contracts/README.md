# Viem Contracts Example

This quick-start example shows the simplest and most common way to interact with smart contracts on VeChain using the Viem-based API. It walks through creating a PublicClient, defining a minimal ERC-20 ABI, loading a contract instance, and performing basic read-only calls such as balanceOf, symbol, and decimals. The goal is to give developers a clear, lightweight introduction to contract interaction on VeChain—showing how easy it is to connect to the testnet, load a contract, and retrieve on-chain data with strong TypeScript typing and a familiar Viem-style interface.
