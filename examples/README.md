# Examples

The `examples/` directory is a growing & living folder, and open for contributions.  
Each example can be opened in a StackBlitz project, so people can start with the example easily.  

The `examples/thor` directory gives examples using `thor-client` and thor specifics.  
The `examples/viem` directory gives examples using the `viem` compatibility layer.
