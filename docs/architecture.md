# Architecture

The chapter is designed to provide a high-level understanding of the vechain SDK architecture and structure. 
Comprehensive diagrams, following the C4 model, are available for reference in the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/tree/main/docs/diagrams/architecture).

## Introduction

Basically the `vechain-sdk` is a monorepo divided into different packages:

- **Core Package**
- **Error Package**
- **Network Package**
- **Hardhat Plugin Package**
- **Logging Package**
- **Provider Package**
- **RPC Proxy Package**


Each of these packages has its own responsibility and is described in the following chapters.

### Core Package
The core package is the core functionality responsible package of the vechain-sdk.
It is responsible for all core functionality of the vechain-sdk.

### Error Package
The error package is the error handling responsible package of the vechain-sdk.
It is responsible for all error handling of the vechain-sdk.

### Network Package
The network package is the network interaction responsible package of the vechain-sdk.
It is responsible for all interactions with the blockchain.

### Hardhat Plugin Package
Seamlessly integrate the vechain SDK with Hardhat, the Ethereum development environment. 
This plugin provides a bridge between the vechain SDK and the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling you to leverage the best of both worlds.

### Logging Package
The logging package provides a simple and easy-to-use logging system for the vechain SDK. 
This module is dedicated to managing and customizing logs within the SDK, ensuring your development experience remains transparent and insightful.

### Provider Package
Get the maximum of EVM development stack with provider package. 
This module is dedicated to managing the compatibility with ethers and EVM world.

### RPC Proxy Package
This package is designed to bridge the gap between Thor's RESTful API and Ethereum's JSON-RPC.
