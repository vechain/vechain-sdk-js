# Accounts

Vechain SDK employs two primary classes, mnemonics and keystore, to facilitate account handling.

## Mnemonics

Mnemonics represent a standard human-readable approach to generate private keys. They consist of a set of words that are human-friendly and can be converted into entropy for generating private keys using derivation paths and various cryptography concepts. Notably, this process adheres to standards such as BIP-32, BIP-39, and BIP-44. These standards provide specifications and guidelines for mnemonic phrase generation, hierarchical deterministic wallets, and key derivation.

### BIP-39

BIP-39, or Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39, outlines a standard for creating mnemonic phrases to represent private keys. 
These mnemonic phrases are typically generated as a sequence of words chosen from a predefined list, which makes them easier for humans to remember and transcribe accurately.
BIP-39 provides several benefits:
 - **Human Readability**: Mnemonic phrases are constructed from a fixed set of words, typically 12 or 24, chosen from a predefined list. This makes them easier for users to write down and remember compared to raw private keys.
 - **Error Detection**: BIP-39 includes a checksum in the mnemonic phrase, which allows for simple error detection. If a word is mistyped or omitted, the checksum will fail to validate, alerting the user to the error.
 - **Compatibility**: BIP-39 mnemonics are widely supported across different wallets and applications within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This ensures interoperability and ease of use for users who wish to access their funds from different platforms.
 - **Security**: By generating private keys from a mnemonic phrase, users can securely back up and restore their wallets. As long as the mnemonic phrase is kept secure, users can recover their funds even if their original device is lost or damaged.

### BIP-32

BIP-32, or Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 32, defines a standard for hierarchical deterministic wallets (HD wallets). 
HD wallets allow for the generation of a tree-like structure of keys derived from a single master seed.
This hierarchy provides several advantages, including:
 - **Deterministic Key Generation**: All keys in an HD wallet are derived from a single master seed. This means that a user only needs to back up their master seed to recover all of their derived keys, rather than backing up each key individually.
 - **Hierarchical Structure**: HD wallets use a tree-like structure to organize keys. This allows for the creation of multiple accounts or sub wallets within a single wallet, each with its own unique set of keys derived from the master seed.
 - **Security**: By using a master seed to derive keys, HD wallets simplify the backup and recovery process while maintaining security. As long as the master seed is kept secure, all derived keys are also secure.
 - **Privacy**: HD wallets provide improved privacy by generating a new public key for each transaction. This prevents observers from linking multiple transactions to a single wallet address.

### Extended Public Key (xpub)

An extended public key (xpub) is derived from an HD wallet's master public key (often referred to as an extended private key, xprv). It represents a point in the HD wallet's key derivation path from which child public keys can be derived, but not private keys. This allows for the creation of a "watch-only" wallet, where the ability to generate transactions is restricted, enhancing security.

### HDNode Instance

In the context of hierarchical deterministic wallets, an HDNode instance represents a node in the hierarchical tree structure of keys. This node can be derived from a parent node using specific derivation paths. HDNode instances encapsulate information such as the private key, public key, chain code, and index, allowing for secure and efficient key derivation.

### From Public Key

Generating an HDNode instance from an extended public key (xpub) allows developers to derive child public keys for purposes such as address generation, transaction monitoring, or building hierarchical structures within the wallet. This functionality is particularly useful in scenarios where the private keys are stored securely offline, and only public keys are exposed to the network for enhanced security.

## Keystore

On the other hand, Keystore is employed for encrypting private keys in accordance with the Ethereum standard. By using Keystore, the private keys can be securely encrypted to prevent unauthorized access or exposure.

Through the use of mnemonics and keystore, vechain SDK ensures secure and user-friendly account handling. Mnemonics allow for easy generation of private keys, while keystore provides an additional layer of protection by encrypting the private keys in a standardized manner as per Ethereum's security practices. These functionalities collectively contribute to a robust and secure approach to managing accounts within the Thor ecosystem.
