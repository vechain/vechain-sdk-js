 *

 *  new block.
 *
 *  **``"error"``** - calls the listener on each async error that occurs during
 *  the event loop, with the error.
 *
 *  **``"debug"``** - calls the listener on debug events, which can be used to
 *  troubleshoot network errors, provider problems, etc.
 *
 *  **``transaction hash``** - calls the listener on each block after the
 *  transaction has been mined; generally ``.once`` is more appropriate for
 *  this event.
 *
 *  **``Array``** - calls the listener on each log that matches the filter.
 *
 *  **EventFilter** - calls the listener with each matching log
