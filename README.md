## SDK Development

### Prerequisites

> **Note** <br />
> Docker is required for setting up a local thor-solo node for integration testing.
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en): versions 18, 19, 20 (LTS), 21 (latest)
 - [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
 - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Getting Started
1. Clone your forked repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.

### Commands

- **Build**: Execute `yarn build` to build the project.
- **Test**: Execute `yarn test:solo` to run all tests.
  - **NOTE**: Integration tests require a local thor-solo node. See the [Integration Testing](#integration-testing) section for more details. 
- **Lint**: Execute `yarn lint` to lint all packages.
- **Format**: Execute `yarn format` to format all packages.

## Integration Testing

This section provides guidance on conducting integration tests using a local thor-solo node. Ensure Docker is operational on your system before proceeding.

### Setting Up

The integration tests interact with a local thor-solo node. This node utilizes the `thor-solo/instance-a4988aba7aea69f6-v3/main.db` data directory, which is pre-configured with a block history and 20 seeded accounts for testing.

### Running Tests

There are two ways to run tests:

1. **Manual start of thor-Solo node**:
   - To start the thor-Solo node manually, use the command `yarn start-thor-solo`.
   - Once the local thor-Solo node is running, integration tests can be executed with `yarn test`.
   - After testing is complete, stop the node with `yarn stop-thor-solo`.
   
2. **Simple execution**:
   - For a more straightforward approach, use `yarn test:solo`.
   - This command handles the thor-Solo node's start and stop processes for you.

### Custom thor-solo Data Starting Point

For advanced testing scenarios, you may require a custom data starting point with thor-solo. This involves creating a custom snapshot of thor's LevelDB.

#### Creating a Custom LevelDB Snapshot

1. **Start thor-solo with Persistence**:
   - Launch thor-solo using Docker with the `--persist` flag. This enables data persistence.
   - Use the `--data-dir` flag to specify the directory where thor-solo will store its data.

2. **Perform Transactions**:
   - Execute the necessary transactions or operations in thor-solo. These transactions will be recorded in the specified data directory.
   - An example of transactions performed to seed the 20 accounts is found in the `thor-solo-seeding.ts` file

3. **Export LevelDB**:
   - Once you've completed the transactions, use a tool like `docker cp` to export the LevelDB directory (i.e., `instance-a4988aba7aea69f6-v3`) from the Docker container.

#### Using the Custom Snapshot

1. **Prepare the Dockerfile**:
   - Modify the Dockerfile used for building the thor-solo container. Ensure it copies the exported LevelDB snapshot into the correct path within the container.

2. **Update Data Directory Path**:
   - Adjust the `--data-dir` flag in your thor-solo startup script or Docker command to point to the new LevelDB snapshot location within the container.

3. **Restart thor-solo**:
   - Rebuild and restart the thor-solo container with the updated Dockerfile. This will launch thor-solo with your custom data starting point.


## Documentation and Examples

- The `./docs` directory houses extensive code examples written as executable demonstrations.
- Dive into the [examples](./docs/README.md) for a hands-on understanding of the SDK capabilities.
- For a comprehensive overview of the package structure, please refer to our [Architecture Diagrams](./docs/diagrams/) located in the documentation directory.
- You can also create and test your examples using `yarn test:examples` command (with solo `yarn test:examples:solo`).
